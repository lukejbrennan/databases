<b> Relational Schema </b>

<br />
<br />

Ingredients(Name [key], Calories, Price, Amount, Recipe_Name [key], Cook Time, Directions [key], Recipe_Calories, Recipe_Price)


<br />
<br />
<b> Tools </b>

<br />
<br />

We will be using the main tools made available to us. We will use MySQL for the database and a combination of HTML/PHP, Javascript, and CSS for the user interface. These are obvious choices due to their relative simplicity and the lack of a need for other tools. We will use a Python scraping script to collect our data.

<br />
<br />

<b> How We Got the Data </b>

<br />
<br />

We are taking the data (recipes) from the website AllRecipes. We will use a scraper in the form of a Python script to do this, storing all of the collected data on dsg1. 

<br />
<br />

<b> Labor Division </b>

<br />
<br />

We will work together more often than not, utilizing paired-progamming when necessary. We would all like to come out of the project having learned as much as possible, so we will all touch each part of the project. We'll outline a major responsibility for each person, but we'll all work together to reach the final goal.
