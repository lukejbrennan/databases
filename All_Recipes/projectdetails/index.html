				&emsp; <i>You are hungry. You are STARVING! But you only have spaghetti sauce and noodles in your fridge. What can you make?! Who knows?! Our website does! You can input a list of ingredients and the website will return a list of recipes that only use those ingredients or it can return a list of recipes that include those ingredients. That way, even if you have Nothing in the Fridge â„¢ you can make dinner!</i>
				<br />
				<br />
				&emsp; <b> Description: </b>

				<br />
				&emsp; NITF&trade; will take an input of ingredients and with those ingredients will query a database containing a list of recipes. Each recipe will contain a list of ingredients, a name, a set of directions, and a cook time. After finding a recipe either only containing the listed ingredients or containing the listed ingredients as well as additional ingredients, the database will return the names of the recipes. The user can then click on a recipe and receive more details on the recipe.	

				<br />
				<br />
				&emsp; <b> Why is this useful? </b>
				<br />

				&emsp; We've all been in a situation in which there's food in the fridge, but we have no idea what to make for dinner. NITF&trade; will take your available ingredients and find a recipe to fit your needs! While there are other websites out there that perform similar actions, they fail to limit their results to only inputted ingredients.

				<br />
				<br />

				&emsp; <b> Where is the data coming from? </b>

				<br />
				&emsp; Using a script, we will pull data from the website "AllRecipes". There is a possibility that we may decide to use a different website.
				<br />
				<br />

				&emsp; <b> Basic Functions </b>
				<br />
				&emsp; <i>Insert</i> - Insert will allow for new recipes to be added into the recipe database
				<br />
				&emsp; <i>Update</i> - Update will allow for recipes to be changed. For example, if a recipe needed to be changed from needing 2 cups of salt to 2 tsp of salt.
				<br />
				&emsp; <i>Delete</i> - Delete will allow for recipes to be deleted. Say your recipe caused a minor case of food poisoning at your family Thanksgiving dinner. Delete will allow for that recipe to be deleted for all of time. 
				<br />
				<br />

				&emsp; <b> Advanced Functions </b>
				<br />
				&emsp; Note: We will probably only choose 2-3 of these ideas.
				<br />
				<br />
				&emsp; <i>Price Determination</i> - 
				This function will take an estimated guess to the cost of your meal. This will allow users to feel pretty good about their choice to eat in and make a meal.
				<br />
				<br />
				&emsp; <i>Calories Counter</i> - 
				This function will estimate the amount of calories in your meal. This will allow users who are trying to #weightloss or #carboload to keep track of their calorie count.
				<br />
				<br />
				&emsp; <i>Inspirational Image</i> - 
				This function will find photos of your website on the interwebs. If a user searched for a burger recipe, this function will search and display images for burgers. This will give our users inspiration to go out and cook their meal. 
				<br />
				<br />
				&emsp; <i>Recipe Recommender</i> - 
				This function will require users to create an account. As users start to find and make recipes with our database, this function will start to develop a "knowledge" of what a particular user likes to eat. Once the user has made enough recipes, recipe recommender will start to recommend ideas for the suer before she searches for a partiular recipe.
